Things I have explored so far is HTML,CSS,JS. A bit of Data Analysis, C++ for DSA.

I have a keen interest in becoming a full time Painter once I graduate because growing up all I had done is Oil paintings. This passion of mine makes me interested in Frontend. I may not be as experienced but I would still love to learn whatever is being offered to my plate.
